    Breaking News: Local Fire Department Responds to Kitchen Fire
    
    Yesterday evening, the Springfield Fire Department successfully contained a kitchen fire 
    at 123 Oak Street. The fire started around 6:30 PM when a cooking pot was left unattended. 
    Firefighters arrived within minutes and prevented the fire from spreading to other parts 
    of the house. No injuries were reported, and the family was safely evacuated.
    
    Fire Chief Johnson stated, "This incident serves as a reminder to always stay in the 
    kitchen while cooking and to keep pot handles turned inward."
